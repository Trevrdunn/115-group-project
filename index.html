       <h2 class="subheader">Day in the life of a SWE</h2>
       
       <p>Junior developers are one of the biggest assets to any software company. After 5–10 years, these young men & women are the ones who decide where the company is heading in the future. Therefore, turning them into great individual contributors is a win-win for both those developers and the company.</p>
       
       <p>A day in the life of a junior engineer consists of about 90% of coding and 10% meetings. As of recently, the role requires you to work from home. Junior software developers are placed in various teams that work on specific projects in the company. A junior developer at Facebook could work in Infrastructure Systems, Data Center Engineering and Developer Tools. It is important for junior software developers to be engaged during meetings and communicate problems they may have with their code. Due to the fact that managers may have a higher expectation from new developers, junior software engineers are encouraged to learn as much languages and algorithms to further their career. 
      </p>

       <h2>Salary</h2>
       
       <p>As a beginner junior software engineer the starting salary estimate is between $76,267 to $79, 698, however this is the estimated quote for those who work in Seattle, Washington. This estimate can be averaged to about 30 to 33 dollars per hour, as the tech boom in Seattle has brought a pay increase compared to many other states, where the average salary is lower than expected. In contrast, the national average salary for a junior software engineer around the US is currently estimated at around 63,000 , in which cases it can potentially be higher or lower depending on the state.</p>
       <h2>Pathway</h2>

       <p>The pathway to becoming a junior software engineer is interesting in the beginning compared to many. As a beginner you start off with a single choice; your willingness to leanr. Junior software engineers go through a process called the ‘technical interview’ that consists of algorithm questions. Companies assess you on the solutions you give to solve these questions. In this career, the more you strive to understand the better it is to get promoted.  After this role you could land a position from junior developers to software engineers, then senior software engineer. Succeeding in this occupation, software engineer's are then offered two occupational branch options to continue with, which are technical architect and lead developers. Finally depending on the preceding branch occupation chosen, the transition happens into becoming a development team lead or a software development manager.</p>
